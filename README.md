# MFCC-based-analysis-in-Parkinson-s-disease
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurological disorder resulting from the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons, which leads to speech production disorders, particularly at the level of the vibratory and articulatory aspects. Early medical observation of voice disorders can be difficult, hence the growing interest in voice analysis-based diagnoses using machine learning methods. 
Mel frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) are widely used in speech and audio processing as they capture valuable insight about the shape of the vocal tract.
The objective of this study was to investigate the relevance of MFCC coefficients as descriptors for identifying abnormal vibratory patterns indicative of Parkinson's disease during sustained vowel production. Therefore, we perform a comparative analysis of different classification techniques
